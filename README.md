This project is a (work in progress) formalization of the
[Rupert Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_cube) in
the [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) theorem prover.

Roughly speaking, the problem asks:
given two congruent copies of a convex polyhedron,
can we cut a hole in one copy, such that the other copy fits through the hole?

Known solutions for Platonic, Catalan, and Archimedean solids are
visualized in this video:
